/*
 * libredwood-fairplay.dylib: code of ours inside fairplayd.H2 (see inject.c for how it gets there).
 *
 * Why. The App Store's front page never loads, and the root of that is not in the store: an
 * AppleMediaServices thread inside appstored sits in a Mach call in _AMSFairPlayGetDeviceType
 * waiting for a reply, and seventeen promises queue behind that one wait (src/inject_store.c). The
 * reply never comes because com.apple.fairplayd.H2 starts, exits 0 at once and is restarted by
 * launchd every ten seconds -- 34 times in a six-minute session, each "Service only ran for 0
 * seconds". It does not crash; it declines to work. A daemon in that state leaves no failed lookup
 * at all, which is why the shape was invisible to the method that found apsd.
 *
 * What this does. Nothing is replaced: it only watches, through dyld's interposing (__DATA,__interpose,
 * as src/inject_app.c does), the four calls that decide whether fairplayd has anything to work with:
 *   IOServiceMatching            -- THE NAME IT LOOKS FOR, which is the one thing a driver of ours
 *                                   has to answer to; the binary is obfuscated and does not carry it
 *                                   as a plain string, so it is asked for at run time instead of guessed
 *   IOServiceGetMatchingServices -- and whether anything was found
 *   IOServiceOpen                -- the user client it wants (its entitlement names
 *                                   com_apple_driver_FairPlayIOKitUserClient) and the type
 *   IOConnectCallMethod          -- every selector it then sends, which is the minimum set a stub
 *                                   would have to implement
 * and exit(), with a walk up the frame pointers, which says where it decides to leave.
 *
 * The fault reporter is here as well: an Objective-C exception ends in abort(), and iOS answers a
 * crash in a stock daemon with "Failed to send exception EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY" and nothing else.
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERED, and it says the obvious next step would have been the wrong one. Over three runs:
 *   argv[0] = /usr/sbin/fairplayd.H2, one argument, as Apple's own job plist asks for (ours matches
 *     it field for field but KeepAlive, which mkjobs.py drops; MachServices are all three there)
 *   open() of the CoreFoundation and containermanagerd feature flags, and of /usr/sbin/Info.plist
 *     -- CFBundle finding its own bundle, and nothing else. WITH THE RESULTS, which is the only way
 *     to tell "it read the flags" from "it tried and got ENOENT": the four that exist on the volume
 *     are opened successfully (Global.plist, GlobalDisclosures.plist, Domain/CoreFoundation.plist,
 *     Domain/containermanagerd.plist -> fd 3), and every -1 is a file a stock iPhone has not got
 *     either (/Library/Preferences/FeatureFlags/..., Settings.plist, Profiles.plist, and
 *     /usr/sbin/Info.plist, which no unbundled daemon has). Nothing it needs is missing from this
 *     image: the feature flags are not the reason it leaves.
 *   NOT ONE IOServiceMatching, IOServiceGetMatchingService(s), IOServiceOpen or IOConnectCallMethod
 *   no xpc_connection_create_mach_service, no sysctlbyname, no dlopen, no stat or mkdir of its own
 *   the exit handler runs, so it leaves of its own accord -- and neither exit() nor _exit() nor
 *     abort() is caught, so main simply returns
 *   and the sampler: every program counter of its ~10 ms of life, 13 to 25 samples, lies inside its
 *     own binary (0x1000d9a40 to 0x1008565ac, which is 0xd9a40 to 0x8565ac into the file). Not one
 *     sample in the shared cache.
 * So it decides with code we cannot interpose, inlining whatever syscalls it makes -- which is what
 * an obfuscated FairPlay binary would do on purpose. IT NEVER ASKS IOKIT FOR ANYTHING, so a stub of
 * com_apple_driver_FairPlayIOKit in the kernel, which was the plan after the last finding, would not
 * be reached at all: the daemon gives up before that. (Its entitlement does name
 * com_apple_driver_FairPlayIOKitUserClient, which is what made the driver look like the next step.)
 * One guess checked and killed before it cost a run: not the platform-binary flag. iOS's own
 * binaries are ad hoc signed and this kernel marks exactly those as platform binaries
 * (bsd/kern/kern_minimac.c), so fairplayd is one here.
 * Two warnings for whoever reads this next.
 * AN ENTITLEMENT NAMES WHAT A PROGRAM MAY DO, NEVER WHAT IT DOES. fairplayd's signature carries
 * com.apple.security.iokit-user-client-class = com_apple_driver_FairPlayIOKitUserClient, and on that
 * evidence a kernel driver looked like the obvious next piece of work. It never opens one. The
 * entitlement is permission, not behaviour, and one run of watching beat a day of writing.
 * AND mkjobs.py DROPS KeepAlive from the job plists it makes (ours is Apple's field for field
 * otherwise, MachServices included). Harmless here -- launchd restarts fairplayd anyway, on demand,
 * 34 times in six minutes -- but worth knowing, because a daemon that is meant to stay resident and
 * is not kept alive looks exactly like a daemon that quits, and two shapes with the same log have
 * cost this project an evening once already.
 *
 * WHAT THE SYSTEM-CALL TRACE ADDS (systrace=2 systrace_name=fairplayd.H2, which logs every BSD call
 * of one process and nothing else -- a few hundred lines rather than a flood). Its whole life, by
 * census over four of its starts: open x241, write x220, close x78, mprotect x57, stat64 x54,
 * getattrlist x45, lseek x39, pread x39, SYSCTL x33, mmap x31, fcntl x24, munmap x21, kevent_qos
 * x16, sigaction x15, thread_selfid x13, proc_info x12, fsgetpath x12, __MAC_SYSCALL x12, openat
 * x12, geteuid x12. The opens are the feature flags and its own bundle, and the writes at the end
 * are OUR OWN lines, not its: it prints nothing of its own before leaving.
 * Three things follow. It touches no IOKit node, no socket and no file of its own, so those theories
 * are closed by trace and not by inference. It calls SYSCTL by number, never sysctlbyname -- which
 * is why the hook on the name caught nothing all along, the wrong-name shape once more; the numeric
 * one is hooked now. And __mac_syscall x12 is the channel to AMFI and the sandbox, so a question
 * asked there is among the few things left that it could be deciding on.
 * Mach traps are not BSD calls and so are invisible to this trace: whatever it asks over Mach --
 * including a bootstrap check-in -- would not appear here.
 *
 * AND A LIMIT WORTH KNOWING BEFORE ANYONE TRIES AGAIN: __sysctl and __mac_syscall were hooked here
 * too, and neither fired, while the kernel's own trace counted 33 and 12 of them in the same life.
 * open() and access() fire in the same build, 1300 lines of them, so the library is plainly there.
 * The reason is the mechanism, not the names this time: dyld interposing replaces a symbol where one
 * image calls ANOTHER image's stub, and these calls are made inside libsystem itself. USER-SPACE
 * INTERPOSING CANNOT SEE A LIBSYSTEM-INTERNAL SYSCALL. For arguments to those, the instrument has to
 * be the kernel: systrace already prints the call and the return, and printing the sysctl MIB and
 * the __mac_syscall policy and request beside them is a small addition in the same place
 * (xnu/redwood.patch, systrace_report). That is the next instrument, and it wants a kernel build.
 * It mattered because this kernel's AMFI stand-in answers exactly two requests, 0x5a and 0x60, and
 * returns ENOPOLICY to every other (bsd/kern/kern_minimac.c), and a daemon refused there would be
 * refused invisibly. MEASURED, AMFI IS CLEARED, and by two roads at once.
 * The kernel's own trace, once it was taught to print the policy and the return:
 *   policy "AMFI" request 90 = 0          (0x5a, the dyld policy check, answered)
 *   policy "Sandbox" request 2 = 0, request 4 = 0
 * and not one other request, not one ENOPOLICY. (That 0x5a is also the known call to check the
 * instrument against: it is dyld's, it happens at every process start, and seeing it with its
 * return proves the trace prints both halves.)
 * And a static read of the binary agrees from the other side: fairplayd.H2 imports neither
 * __mac_syscall nor sysctl, and has no svc instruction anywhere in its text, so the twelve AMFI and
 * thirty-three sysctl calls in its trace belong to dyld, libSystem and CoreFoundation -- not to it.
 * It imports no exit either, so its departure is a return from main, which is a decision and not a
 * refusal: a MAC denial forced by the kernel kills a process, it does not give a clean exit(0).
 *
 * The next instrument should therefore be on the other side of the wall: this kernel is ours, so
 * logging the system calls of the process named fairplayd.H2 sees through the inlining that defeats
 * interposing. The other way in is to read the binary, and this project has a worked path for
 * exactly that (it is what the camera work used on CMCapture): Ghidra in ~/.local/share/ghidra,
 * imported with -noanalysis because a full analysis runs for hours, a project under
 * ~/ghidra-projects whose path has no dot in it, and ~/.local/share/ghidra/tools/dec.sh to
 * decompile by symbol with the cache's island and stub names filled in; got.py, cfstr.py and
 * callers.py beside it; "ipsw dyld" only for dump, a2s and a2f, since disass runs out of memory.
 * The window is small: offsets 0xd9a40 to 0x8565ac of /usr/sbin/fairplayd.H2, and what to look for
 * is an early return from main and the strings of whatever it compared against just before -- a
 * comparison, not a failed call, since every sampled program counter is in code Apple shipped
 * precisely so that it could not be watched from outside.
