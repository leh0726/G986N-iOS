/*
 * libredwood-store.dylib: code of ours inside appstored (see inject.c for how it gets there).
 *
 * What it is for. The App Store opens and shows LOADING for ever. The front page is a "bag" --
 * AppleMediaServices' configuration -- and AMS will not load one until it knows the storefront, the
 * number that says which country's store this device belongs to. Everything outside the process has
 * been measured and is well:
 *   - the bag itself is fetched from this phone by hand, 56 KB in half a second, and the server
 *     hands over a storefront in the bargain: "x-set-apple-store-front: 143469-2,8" from both
 *     bag.itunes.apple.com and init.itunes.apple.com (rc.jobs.store, src/net_test.m);
 *   - appstored opens no socket at all while the store spins, so nothing is failing on the network;
 *   - the storefront cannot be put on the device from another process: AMS's "local" account is not
 *     a row in accountsd at all -- a different identifier every boot -- so there is nothing to write
 *     to and nothing that would keep (src/store_test.m).
 *
 * So the storefront is not written anywhere here either. The account is made to ANSWER with one:
 * -[ACAccount ams_storefront] is the door every consumer in AMS goes through, and its neighbours are
 * taken in the same pass because different callers knock at different ones. No persistence, no
 * accountsd, nothing that outlives the process.
 *
 * And the question that is worth more than the storefront: is a bag request ever built? From outside
 * only the socket log could answer, and only negatively, over a console that drops lines. From in
 * here it can be answered positively. -[AMSBagNetworkTask _performFetchWithAttemptedCount:account:
 * storefront:] and its _queryItemsForClientInfo:... are where a request is assembled: they are not
 * replaced, only watched, and what they were called with is written down. If neither is entered,
 * nothing about the network matters and the gate is above them.
 *
 * The storefront is 143469-2,8 because that is what Apple's own bag server returned for THIS device
 * when asked with none -- a region, picked from the address the request came from. No Apple ID is
 * signed in, none can be, and the store must still refuse to install: there is nothing to buy with.
 *
 * AppleMediaServices and Accounts are not loaded yet when this library is: the methods are taken
 * when their images arrive (_dyld_register_func_for_add_image).
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERED. The storefront was the gate, and it is not the only one.
 *   entered    3 -[ACAccount ams_storefront]                     (answered 143469-2,8; was (nil))
 *   entered    3 -[AMSBagActiveAccountProvider _bagAccountForAccountMediaType:mustContainStorefront:]
 *                 mustContainStorefront:0 -> the local account, mustContainStorefront:1 -> (nil)
 *   entered    1 -[AMSBagNetworkTask _performFetchWithAttemptedCount:account:storefront:]
 *                 "BAG FETCH attempt 0, storefront 143469-2,8, account local (...)" -> a promise
 *   entered    1 -[AMSBagNetworkTask _createRequestWithQueryItems:] -> <AMSMutablePromise: ...>
 *   entered    0 -[AMSBagNetworkTask URLSessionPromise]
 *   entered    0 -[AMSURLSession dataTaskPromiseWithRequest:]
 *   entered    0 -[AMSURLSession dataTaskWithRequest:]
 *   entered    0 -[NSURLSessionTask resume]
 * So with a storefront to answer with, AMS DOES build a bag request -- that question is settled, and
 * positively, from inside. And the request never becomes a transfer: it is assembled into an
 * AMSMutablePromise that nothing ever resolves, so no session is asked for, no task is made and
 * nothing is ever resumed. Not one task is resumed in the whole daemon in a six-minute session,
 * which is why the socket log never had appstored in it. The store still shows LOADING, as it must:
 * the bag never loads.
 * AND THEN, with entry and exit counted separately -- a method that hangs and a method that is
 * never called leave the same silence below them, so every wrapper counts both:
 *   entered    1 returned    1 -[AMSBagNetworkTask _createRequestWithQueryItems:]
 *   entered    0 returned    0  the four steps that finish a request (cookies, storefront header,
 *                               anisette headers, -[AMSURLSession _prepareRequest:properties:error:])
 *   entered   12 returned   12 -[AMSMutablePromise continueWithBlock:]
 *   entered    5 returned    5 -[AMSMutablePromise thenWithBlock:]
 *   entered    1 returned    1 -[AMSMutablePromise _finishWithResult:error:logDuplicateFinishes:]
 * Nothing hangs. _createRequestWithQueryItems: returns at once, with a promise -- and that promise is
 * never finished. Seventeen continuations are attached to promises in that session and exactly ONE
 * promise is ever finished, and by address it is not the request's:
 *   PROMISE 0x101709240 waited on (continue)
 *   STEP _createRequestWithQueryItems: -> <AMSMutablePromise: 0x10170b930>
 *   PROMISE 0x10170b930 waited on (then) / (continue)
 *   PROMISE 0x101414370 finished          <- the only one, and a different promise
 * So the bag request is never produced at all: the step that would produce it is waiting on
 * something that never arrives, which is why no header is ever added, no session asked for, no task
 * made and nothing resumed. The anisette guess is ruled out with the other three: none is entered.
 *
 * AND THE THREADS SAY WHY, which is a bigger thing than the bag. All eleven threads of the daemon
 * are waiting (run state 3; one idle libdispatch worker in __workq_kernreturn, so the queues are not
 * starved of threads), and four of them are in the same place:
 *   -[AMSBagValue valueWithError:] -> -[AMSPromise resultWithError:] -> resultBeforeDate:error:
 *   -> -[NSConditionLock lockWhenCondition:beforeDate:] -> -[NSCondition waitUntilDate:]
 * -- a thread blocked until the bag loads. Walking every thread's frames and giving them to
 * "ipsw dyld a2s" names the circle:
 *   -[AMSBagNetworkTask performFetch]_block_invoke
 *     -> -[AMSBagActiveAccountProvider bagStorefrontForAccountMediaType:]
 *       -> _bagAccountForAccountMediaType:mustContainStorefront:
 *         -> -[ACAccountStore _ams_localiTunesAccountAfterUpdatingStorefront:]
 *           -> -[AMSPromise resultWithError:], for ever
 * while the promise it waits on is finished by the continuation of
 * _fetchLocaliTunesAccountForAccountType:shouldUpdateStorefront: running
 * _updateStorefrontInLocalAccount:, which is blocked in resultWithError: on another thread. The
 * thread that would fetch the bag waits on an account update that waits on the bag.
 * (The same walk explains an earlier puzzle: the cookies are added by the FOUR-argument
 * ams_addCookiesForAccount:clientInfo:bag:cleanupGlobalCookies:, inside
 * -[AMSURLRequestEncoder requestByEncodingRequest:parameters:], which is why a hook on the
 * three-argument one was never entered.)
 * Answering _ams_localiTunesAccountAfterUpdatingStorefront: at once (above) does cut that wait --
 * _bagAccountForAccountMediaType: goes from blocked to 3 entered 3 returned -- and the bag still
 * does not load: four threads are still blocked in resultBeforeDate:error: elsewhere. So the stall
 * is not one method; AMS's promises in this daemon are not being completed at all.
 *
 * THE ROOT, found by the promise graph rather than by recognising another circle. Every promise is
 * remembered here by address, with where it was first seen, how many continuations were attached,
 * which threads block in it and whether it was ever finished; the table is printed at 150 s beside
 * the thread dump, and a promise with waiters and no finish is marked. Sixteen promises in a
 * session, seven of them so marked, the bag's request and the bag's fetch among them. Following the
 * threads of the marked ones down (ipsw dyld a2s again) ends outside AMS altogether:
 *   thread 4: mach_msg2_trap <- _AMSFairPlayGetDeviceType <- _CjHbHx <- (three FairPlay functions)
 * -- an AMS thread blocked in a Mach call into FairPlay, waiting for a reply. And in the same
 * session's launchd log:
 *   com.apple.fairplayd.H2: 34 spawns, every one "Service only ran for 0 seconds",
 *   "exited due to exit(0)", "service throttled by 10 seconds"
 * fairplayd does not crash: it starts, decides there is nothing it can do here, and leaves at once,
 * over and over. So the reply AMS is waiting for never comes, the promise behind it is never
 * fulfilled, and seventeen waits queue behind that one. The storefront deadlock sits on top of this,
 * not beside it.
 * The next piece of work is therefore not in AMS at all: find why fairplayd.H2 exits 0 immediately
 * and keep it up. Everything in this file above that line is a consequence of it.
 *
 * Two things this library learned about itself, for whoever writes the next one:
 *   - class_getInstanceMethod walks up the chain, so replacing what a class only INHERITS replaces it
 *     for everything else that inherits it too. Doing that to an NSObject category restarted
 *     appstored 31 times in one run. image_added now refuses anything the superclass answers to.
 *   - an ObjC exception ends in abort(), not in SIGSEGV, so a fault reporter that watches only the
 *     memory signals says nothing at all about the usual way a replacement of ours kills a daemon.

 * WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PAGE AFTER IT ARRIVES. The front page comes down whole and nothing draws it,
 * and the report that showed that also showed something nobody was looking for: THE SAME 177 786
 * BYTES WERE FETCHED TWICE. A document that parsed would not be fetched again, so the likeliest
 * story is loaded, rejected, tried again.
 * JetEngine says how it would reject one. It carries jetpackSignatureVerificationDidFailNotification
 * -- a signature is verified and there is a named way of announcing that it was not liked -- and a
 * JEBrotliDecoder, so the body is compressed before any of that; JetPackSigningPolicy,
 * JetpackSignatureVerifierP, JetPackageFormatParser and JetpackErrorDomain are all in the same
 * library. Every one of those rejects AFTER the bytes are on disk, which is the shape measured.
 * Rather than guess the notification's string (a name is one of the ways an instrument lies -- see
 * below), every notification posted in the process is watched and the ones whose name speaks of
 * jetpacks, signatures, verification or brotli are printed.
 * WHAT IT SAYS. No signature-failure notification is ever posted: 169 to 197 notifications in a
 * session of the app and not one about a jetpack, a signature, verification or brotli -- the only
 * JetEngine notification seen at all is JetEngine.Unstable.Accounts.didChangeNotification, so the
 * engine is alive and posting.
 * AND THE READER IS PLAINLY HAPPY. With the counters printed on their own line, early, instead of as
 * one line of a sixty-line report:
 *   redwood: AppStore: JETPACK processStream: in
 *   redwood: AppStore: JETPACK processStream: out, a result, error (none)
 *   redwood: AppStore: KEY brotli entered 0 returned 0, processStream entered 2 returned 2
 *   redwood: appstored: KEY brotli entered 0 returned 0, processStream entered 0 returned 0
 * -[JPReader processStream:signatureVerifier:options:error:] is entered twice -- once per fetch --
 * and both times it RETURNS A RESULT WITH NO ERROR. So the page is fetched whole and parsed without
 * complaint: it is not the signature, not the package format, and not Brotli (which never runs at
 * all). That retires all three at once, and with them the experiment of swapping
 * +[JPSignatureVerifier defaultSignatureVerifier] for +unsafeIgnoreSignatureVerifier -- there is
 * nothing for it to prove, since the verification already passes. An image that does not verify
 * signatures is a worse thing than an experiment that does not, and this one is not needed.
 * The only C++ exception thrown anywhere in either process is std::future_error (every throw is
 * watched through __cxa_throw, whose type name is the second word of its std::type_info), and it is
 * thrown in appstored as well, where everything now works -- so it looked like a lead and not an
 * answer. COUNTED, it looked less innocent: 95 of them in appstored and 68 in the App Store in one
 * session, with only 4 and 2 NSExceptions beside them, and "seventeen waits and one finish" is the
 * shape a flood of broken promises would make. It was tempting, and it is WRONG.
 * The frames and the times say so, which is why both are printed:
 *   C++ THROW #1 at 0.11 s NSt3__112future_errorE from 0x18ff0bd14 0x18fd1c8b8 0x18fd197f0 ...
 *   0x18ff0bd14: std::make_exception_ptr<std::future_error>
 *   0x18fd1c8b8: std::promise<std::tuple<PromiseResult>>::~promise
 *   0x18fd197f0: std::__shared_ptr_emplace<AMSCore::Future<PromiseResult>::FutureImp>::__on_zero_shared
 *   0x1900b57dc: std::shared_ptr<AMSCore::Future<PromiseResult>::FutureImp>::~shared_ptr
 *   0x18fd1a9c4: -[AMSPromise .cxx_destruct]
 * Every one of the first throws is the same path, and every one is inside the first quarter-second
 * of the process -- 0.11 to 0.26 s, long before anything is fetched. It is an AMSPromise being
 * DEALLOCATED: ~promise stores a broken_promise into the shared state when it is destroyed without
 * a value, which is what the C++ standard says it must do, and make_exception_ptr is how it is
 * stored rather than how it is reported. 163 of them a session is AMS's style of letting go of
 * promises nobody needs, not a flood of failures. The number means nothing on its own, the
 * connection to "nothing asks for content" is disproved, and this paragraph is here so that the
 * next reader does not find the number again and make the same handsome mistake.
 * WHAT IS LEFT is the drawing itself: 177 786 bytes arrive, JPReader parses them into a result, and
 * nothing appears. Whoever owns it next is on the stack when it is handed back, so the walk is done
 * at the exit too, and "ipsw dyld a2s" names the image if not the function:
 *   JETPACK processStream: out, a result, error (none), to 0x19d96245c 0x19d963f88 0x19d9634bc ...
 *   0x19d96245c: func_19d962020 + 1084
 *     dylib=/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/JetEngine.framework/JetEngine
 * -- straight back into JetEngine, into Swift functions the cache carries no names for. That is
 * where the next session starts, and it is static work: the project's Ghidra path (see
 * src/inject_fairplay.c for the tools and their rules).
 * AND THE APP'S OWN WAITS ARE GONE, which is what justifies going there. The graph had shown the app
 * NOT all finished: 192 promises, two threads each parked on two that nobody fulfils -- one in
 * -[ACAccountStore _updateStorefrontInLocalAccount:], one in
 * ams_addCookiesForAccount:clientInfo:bag:cleanupGlobalCookies: inside
 * -[AMSURLRequestEncoder requestByEncodingRequest:parameters:] -- the same family as the deadlock
 * cut in appstored, left over because the hook that cut that one only answers
 * _ams_localiTunesAccountAfterUpdatingStorefront:, and -[AMSBagValue valueWithError:] standing at 92
 * entered and 91 returned, one outstanding at the moment the report printed. Both are answered now
 * (above), and the next run says:
 *   entered   89 returned   89 -[AMSBagValue valueWithError:]
 *   entered  104 returned  104 -[AMSPromise resultBeforeDate:error:]
 *   and not one "STILL IN IT" anywhere in the app
 * Every wait completes, the page is still fetched and still parses without error -- and the screen
 * still says LOADING. So the drawing is not waiting on AppleMediaServices for anything: the last
 * suspects outside JetEngine are cleared, and the static read of its Swift is justified rather than
 * assumed. That is the one thing left and it is the expensive one; it belongs to a fresh session.
 * And SwiftUI itself is not the suspect: the Weather and Calendar home-screen widgets are WidgetKit,
 * which is SwiftUI, and they draw their own content on this phone. Whatever stops _JetEngine_SwiftUI
 * is particular to this path.
 *
 * THE THREE SHAPES OF AN INSTRUMENT THAT LIES, all of them met on this branch, all of them making a
 * thing that happened look like a thing that did not:
 *   the wrong channel -- the library was inside AppStore.app and said nothing, because an app
 *     started by SpringBoard has no console on standard error (say() writes to /dev/console now);
 *   the wrong name -- a hook on ams_addCookiesForAccount:clientInfo:bag: never fired for a whole
 *     evening because the cookies go through the four-argument ...:cleanupGlobalCookies: instead;
 *   the wrong moment -- one report at 150 s, while the App Store starts when it is tapped at 95 s
 *     and its report fell past the end of the run (every minute now);
 *   the wrong order -- the hook on JEBrotliDecoder was NOT TAKEN although the class is plainly in
 *     the process (the report's own selector dump lists its methods): the table is tried when dyld
 *     adds an image, and a Swift framework's classes are registered after that callback runs, so
 *     the one moment it was looked for was the one moment it was not there. The table is tried
 *     again every minute now, which costs nothing and cannot miss a late arrival.
 * The fifth shape belongs in this list when it is found.
 */
/*
 * And the decompression, since no signature-failure notification is ever posted (169 to 197
 * notifications in a session of the app, not one of them about a jetpack, a signature, verification
 * or brotli). JEBrotliDecoder is in the App Store's process and not in appstored, and it answers to
 * -decoder and -decompressStreamWithAvailableIn:nextIn:availableOut:nextOut:. The result is an
 * integer status, so it is printed as one: a decode that never runs and a decode that fails are the
 * same silence otherwise.

/*
 * AND THE SHARPER FACT, which was in the task report all along and wanted reading for the thing
 * nobody was looking for: THE APP MAKES EXACTLY FOUR REQUESTS AND NONE OF THEM IS FOR CONTENT.
 * Three sessions, four tasks each, every time the same four: the bag twice, and
 * apps.mzstatic.com/.../ios-appstore.jetpack twice. The jetpack is the store's user interface, not
 * its content; the Today page's items come from a separate feed (amp-api), and no such request is
 * ever made. So "the page is parsed and not drawn" is better said as: nothing ever asks for anything
 * to draw. That moves the question from "why does JetEngine not draw this document" to "what should
 * have asked for the content once the document was loaded, and why does it not".
 * The next thing to measure is accordingly one step earlier: a task that is created and never
 * resumed is a different story from a task that is never created, and they look the same in a report
 * that only counts resumes. Both are counted now -- and the creation hooks fire for nothing, while
 * four resumes are counted, so the four tasks are made somewhere these two do not see. The fact that
 * matters survives either way: four requests, no feed.
 *
 * WHAT IS REACHABLE IN JetEngine FROM A HOOK, since that decides whether the next step is a run or a
 * week of reading. Of 71 042 Objective-C classes in the App Store's process, 40 are named like Jet
 * and 27 like JE, and they are real: JEBrotliDecoder/Encoder, JETreatment, JETreatmentProfile,
 * JETreatmentContext, JETreatmentAction and the JEDeres* actions, JEMediaActivityTracker,
 * JEMetricsDataPredicate, JEUnfairLock, JEWrappedMetricsPipeline, JetEngine itself, JetUI, and --
 * the one worth taking first -- _TtGC9JetEngine7PromiseT__, which is JetEngine's own Promise.
 * The App Store's page is built on promises of its own, and a promise graph is the instrument that
 * found the root in appstored in one slot. The same graph on JetEngine.Promise, with the entry and
 * exit counted apart, is where the next session should start: it says whether anything is waiting
 * for the content that is never asked for, and it costs a run rather than a read.

 * for a reply that never comes (src/inject_fairplay.c). Before reading an obfuscated daemon to find
 * out why it quits, it is worth knowing whether the store needs its answer in the first place. The
 * top of that stack is an Objective-C method -- -[AMSUserAgent _sharedComponentFairPlayDeviceType],
 * a dispatch_once-memoised lookup that goes down to AMS::FairPlayProvider::getDeviceType() and
 * _AMSFairPlayGetHardwareInfo -- so it costs a method_setImplementation, the same move as the
 * storefront getters.
 * The value is deliberately NOT plausible. A zero or an empty string would travel into the user
 * agent and the Mescal path and read like data; this reads like what it is, and the log says on the
 * same line that it was injected, so that nobody later mistakes it for a measurement.
 * Why the wait looks infinite rather than failed, which is worth keeping in mind: launchd holds a
 * job's MachService port whether or not the job is running, so a client's message is QUEUED, not
 * refused. A daemon that is absent fails fast; a daemon launchd keeps restarting makes its clients
