/*
 * The device object of a Metal driver for this port, as a real library.
 *
 * What Metal demands of a plugin's device class was measured rather than guessed
 * (docs/metal.md section 10): `MTLAddDevice` (0x181a1875c) wants an object that comes back
 * non-nil from -initWithAcceleratorPort:, conforms to MTLDevice and MTLDeviceSPI -- both
 * asserted, both fatal -- and answers -featureProfile, -maxBufferLength and
 * -supportsVertexAmplificationCount:. Four methods. Everything else in the registration
 * path, including the 64-field limits table and the 42 feature queries, _MTLDevice fills
 * in itself once -featureProfile answers.
 *
 * Three decisions in how this is written, each for a measured reason:
 *
 *   - The class is declared in SOURCE, not built with objc_allocateClassPair as the probes
 *     did. That needs the private class symbol at link time, and it is bindable: IOGPU
 *     itself imports `_OBJC_CLASS_$__MTLDevice` together with its metaclass. Only the name
 *     is declared here -- nothing about Apple's 36 ivars or their offsets, which belong to
 *     Metal 306.6.4 and are nowhere written down. Our own ivars are placed by the runtime
 *     after Apple's, which is what the non-fragile ABI is for.
 *   - `<MTLDeviceSPI>` is declared at RUNTIME, with class_addProtocol. The protocol is
 *     private and requires 337 instance methods; writing that declaration out would mean
 *     copying 337 signatures we do not implement, and the only thing the two assertions in
 *     MTLAddDevice read is conformsToProtocol:. One call says the same thing truthfully.
 *     MTLDeviceSPI adopts MTLDevice, so one declaration satisfies both.
 *   - -initWithAcceleratorPort: opens this port's OWN gpu service, `RedwoodGPU`, the way
 *     Mesa's shim does (tools/mesa/redwood-drm/redwood_drm.c: IOServiceOpen with type 0,
 *     then msm-shaped requests through IOConnectCallStructMethod). That is the road the
 *     resource layer will take, and it already carries Mesa's own dispatches today. The
 *     IOGPU road was measured shut: IOServiceOpen on our IOAcceleratorES service with
 *     Apple's type 1 answers kIOReturnUnsupported.
 *
 * The first resource is here too. A Metal buffer on this port is a GEM allocation of the
 * kernel's own gpu driver, made and mapped exactly the way Mesa's shim makes and maps one
 * (tools/mesa/redwood-drm/redwood_drm.c): kMsmGemNew (0x42) for the memory, MSM_INFO_GET_IOVA
 * through kMsmGemInfo (0x43) for the address the GPU sees, IOConnectMapMemory64 for the
 * address the processor sees, kDrmGemClose (0x09) to give it back. The kernel makes that
 * memory write-combined, with no cache of this processor between the program and what the
 * GPU reads, which is also why -didModifyRange: has nothing to do.
 *
 * Metal.framework has no `_MTLBuffer` to inherit -- only `_MTLResource`, a thin base over
 * `_MTLObjectWithLabel` -- so the buffer class is ours, as it is in Apple's own drivers
 * (`IOGPUMetalBuffer`, `AGXA11FamilyBuffer`).
 *
 * The compute path is here too, and it is where subsystem (1) finally carries something.
 * Metal hands a driver one function's LLVM module through -[_MTLFunction bitcodeData], and
 * those bytes were checked against our own AIR reader over all eleven functions of
 * AV1SW.metallib -- same lengths, same checksums (docs/metal.md 10.12). The front end that
 * reads them lives in Mesa, so the compiling and the dispatching are asked of
 * /redwood/lib/libredwoodair.dylib through the contract in tools/mesa/air/air_metal.h.
 *
 * That library is loaded with dlopen rather than linked, for a measured reason: the device
 * object must exist even when there is no GPU. The port starts the Adreno only with the
 * boot argument gpu=1, and a device that refuses to be created at all would take Metal's
 * whole discovery down with it; a device that answers its name and its limits and refuses
 * to make a pipeline is the truthful object in that case.
 *
 * Ordering is Metal's, not Gallium's: an encoder RECORDS its dispatches and the command
 * buffer runs them when it is committed. Dispatching as they are encoded would be less
 * code and would quietly reorder work an application committed in a particular order.
 *
 * Depth and stencil are here, and what that amounts to is four things: a texture of a depth
 * pixel format, an MTLDepthStencilState over the private _MTLDepthStencilState (whose SPI
 * has four methods Apple leaves answering NO, overridden here with the truth about the
 * descriptor), the render pass descriptor's depth and stencil attachments, and the
 * depth-range half of -setViewport:, which is the only thing in Metal that moves this
 * driver's quad in z at all.
 *
 * ARGUMENT BUFFERS are here, and what they are here is a RECORDER: Metal's encoder writes
 * 8-byte handles into a buffer and those are an Apple GPU's descriptors, so this driver
 * records (resource, Metal id) against (destination buffer, destination offset) instead
 * and the draw binds every member the pipeline's shaders declare. The buffer's contents
 * are never read, and an argument buffer the application did not fill through an encoder
 * is refused BY NAME (docs/air.md 8.2, and the MTLArgumentEncoder implementation at the
 * end of this file).
 *
 * BUFFER OFFSETS are honoured, which they were not: Metal's own `offset:` is recorded at
 * the encoder and judged at the draw, where the pipeline says whether an index is a
 * stream, a set or a buffer argument. A `constant` one is served at any offset -- the
 * compiler library uploads the block when the GPU cannot fetch from that offset -- and a
 * `device` one the GPU cannot fetch from is refused by name, because the shader may write
 * it and a copy would lose the writes.
 *
 * What is NOT here, and is not pretended: heaps, blit encoders, events, multisample
 * resolve, and the rectangle half of a viewport -- the rest of docs/metal.md 10.8.
 *
 * Every line this file writes carries the PROCESS it was written by
 * (`redwoodmetal[progname pid]:`, see rw_print): a driver is a library, four or five
 * Metal clients are alive in one boot of this port, and a refusal nobody can attribute
 * is half a refusal.

 * because its table (31 buffers, 16 samplers, 512 threads per threadgroup, 16 KB of

 *
 * "Which profile the hardware deserves is a separate question, to be answered when something
 * is drawn" -- and something has now been drawn, so here is the answer so far. This number is
 * the ONLY input Apple has for what this device supports: -[_MTLDevice initGPUFamilySupport]
 * switches on it and pushes a list of MTLGPUFamily into the vector that -supportsFamily:
 * searches. Profile 0 pushes Apple1 and Common1 and nothing else.
 *
 * That is why SpringBoard cannot start. Siri's orb prewarms an MPSImageGaussianBlur, and
 * MPSDevice::GetMPSDevice is a descending ladder of -supportsFamily: from Apple8 (1008) down
 * to Apple2 (1002) which returns NULL when none answers. It never asks about Apple1 -- the
 * constant 0x3e9 is nowhere in that function -- so the one family we claim is the one family
 * it does not want, and the process aborts in MPSKernel with "Failed to get MPSDevice"
 * (docs/metal.md 10.47). Profile 1 is the lowest that pushes Apple2.
 *
 * So the profile is a boot-arg (metal_profile=N), not because it should stay configurable but
 * because the cost of each step up has to be measured rather than argued: every family claimed
 * is a promise, and some of those promises this driver cannot keep. Answering LESS is not the
 * safe direction either -- an empty family vector makes
 * +[MTLFXSpatialScalerDescriptor supportsDevice:] take this for a discrete GPU and say yes
 * unconditionally -- so there is no answer here that is safe by default, only one that is
 * measured. Apple's own A11 driver answers 5.

 * One sample, STILL -- and this one needs its reason written down, because it is now the

 *
 * The compiler library does make multisample textures since docs/metal.md 10.34: the
 * Adreno gives 2 and 4 samples, a render pass of that count fills one, and a shader reads
 * one with read(coord, sample). So "count == 1" is no longer what this device CAN do with
 * a multisample texture.
 *
 * It is what this device can do with one for an APPLICATION, and that is what the
 * selector asks. An application that is told four samples makes a four-sample attachment
 * and then asks for its result in a one-sample texture -- MTLStoreActionMultisampleResolve,
 * or MTLRenderPassColorAttachmentDescriptor.resolveTexture -- and this driver has neither:
 * the contract stores what it has and resolves nothing. AppleMetalGLRenderer is exactly
 * such an application (its own six multisample fragment shaders are the ones 10.34 is
 * about), and a GL context given an MSAA config it cannot resolve is worse off than one
 * given none. So the yes waits for the resolve, and the measurement of the texture does
 * not wait for the yes: a test binds one without asking.
 *
 * Note also that -supportsTextureSampleCount: is not a second answer to keep in step. It
 * is one instruction in _MTLDevice (0x181a17890) that tail-calls -supportsSampleCount:,
 * which _MTLDevice itself does not implement at all -- so this method is the whole of
 * both, and without it that forward would die on an unrecognized selector naming OUR
 * class (docs/metal.md 10.1's trap).

 * The answer that could not be "nothing", and the first place in this driver where that is

 *
 *   signal 11 at 0x10, pc 0x181a3ca3c, called from 0x18847f6dc
 *
 * which is MTLPipelineLibraryBuilder::newLibraryWithFile + 836, reached from
 * CA::OGL::new_metal_context + 1808 -- QuartzCore asking this device for the precompiled
 * pipelines of its own default.pipelinelib. Nothing of ours is on that stack:
 * -[_MTLDevice newPipelineLibraryWithFilePath:error:] is three instructions (0x181a3d9b0,
 * `mov x1, x0; ldr x0, [x0, #0x180]; b`) that hand the device and its own builder ivar to
 * Apple's C++, which gets as far as parsing pipelines.desc out of the image and then asks us
 * one question. The three instructions that matter:
 *
 *   0x181a3c9ec  objc_opt_respondsToSelector(device, "targetDeviceInfo")   -> YES
 *   0x181a3c9f8  objc_msgSend$targetDeviceInfo                             -> NULL
 *   0x181a3ca3c  ldr x8, [x23, #0x10]                                      -> 0x10
 *
 * Both halves of that are Apple's. `_MTLDevice` HAS an entry for -targetDeviceInfo and its
 * body is `mov x0, #0; ret` (0x181aa8d98 -- tools/metal/absmeth.py calls that a nil-stub),
 * so the runtime answers the question YES on our behalf and the pointer is NULL; and the
 * caller treats a YES as a promise and dereferences what comes back. Declining is therefore
 * not on the table: returning nil IS what crashes, and the only way to make the runtime say
 * NO would be to lie in -respondsToSelector:, which would also lie to every caller that
 * does not ask first. Of the eight objc_opt_respondsToSelector sites in all of
 * Metal.framework this is the only one whose answer is a raw pointer rather than a scalar or
 * an object -- the other seven ask about -shaderDebugInfoCaching, -maximumComputeSubstreams
 * (twice), -presentWithOptions: (twice), -boolValue and one selector held in a register.
 *
 * The shape can recur, and the population is counted rather than feared: of `_MTLDevice`'s
 * 522 instance methods 74 are nil-stubs, and 14 of those are declared to return a raw
 * pointer (absmeth.py joined to protometh.py by implementation address). Thirteen of the
 * fourteen are the pipeline-cache key family -- `*FunctionKeyWith...:keySize:` and
 * `get*FunctionId:compilerOptions:compilerOptionsSize:` -- which is reached only once a
 * pipeline cache actually holds something; this is the fourteenth, and the first one
 * anything asked for.
 *
 * So the struct is real, and its contents are the ones Apple's own code writes in the branch
 * it takes for a device that does not respond (0x181a3ca04): zero, zero, and the device's
 * -name with the spaces removed. Its shape is known twice over, from two sources that agree
 * -- that branch, which builds one on its own stack, and the type MTLDeviceSPI records for
 * this method, `r^{MTLTargetDeviceArch=QI*}16@0:8`. Each field by its reader:
 *
 *   +0x00  nobody on this path reads it, and Apple's branch writes 0.
 *   +0x08  read by -[_MTLPipelineCache initWithFilePath:readOnly:deviceInfo:] (0x181a3b720),
 *          which pairs it with 1 into an MTLCompilerCache::Version for
 *          MTLCompilerCache::createPipelineDataCache. That version decides whether a cache
 *          FILE is stale; this cache is opened read-only (w3=1 at 0x181a3ca64) over a file
 *          no image here has, so there is nothing for it to invalidate, and 0 is the number
 *          Apple's own branch uses. It becomes a real question the day this driver WRITES a
 *          pipeline cache, and not before.
 *   +0x10  formatted into "%s/pipelines.%s" (0x181a3ca48) -- the per-GPU cache file inside
 *          QuartzCore.framework/default.pipelinelib. It must be a C string and not NULL:
 *          Metal's second cache, the one for `functions`, it builds with a zeroed struct and
 *          an EMPTY name itself (0x181a3ca7c), which is the measurement that says a zeroed
 *          struct is acceptable to _MTLPipelineCache.
 *
 * What this buys is a refusal with a reason instead of a crash, and the refusal is the
 * honest one: that image ships `functions` and `pipelines.desc` and no pipelines.* for any
 * GPU at all (not even the A11 this phone was born with), so the cache comes back nil,
 * Metal fills the NSError with "Could not open pipeline cache file: %s" (code 6,
 * 0x181a3cb2c), and QuartzCore logs "Metal failed to load pipeline library: %s" and carries
 * on -- 0x18847f6f0 is a `cbnz`, not an assert. Nothing is lost by it: a precompiled
 * pipeline in that cache would be A11 machine code, which this driver could not run anyway.
 * The pipelines CoreAnimation needs get compiled the ordinary way, through
 * -newRenderPipelineStateWithDescriptor: and AIR.

 * THE SLOT EVERY COMMAND BUFFER TAKES FROM THE QUEUE, AND WHY IT HAS TO BE GIVEN BACK.
 *
 * -[_MTLCommandBuffer initWithQueue:retainedReferences:synchronousDebugMode:] -- the
 * designated initialiser this driver's command buffer calls, because docs/metal.md 10.13
 * says to call the real one -- does this, at 0x181a1ea14 and on:
 *
 *     ldr  x8, [x19, _MTLCommandBuffer._queue]
 *     ldr  x0, [x8, _MTLCommandQueue._commandBufferSemaphore]
 *     mov  x1, #-1                       ; DISPATCH_TIME_FOREVER
 *     bl   dispatch_semaphore_wait
 *
 * and just before it sets _MTLCommandBuffer._needsCommandBufferSemaphoreSignal to 1. The
 * semaphore is made in -[_MTLCommandQueue initWithDevice:descriptor:] (0x181a1d1fc), which
 * reads maxCommandBufferCount off the descriptor (0x181a1d268) and refuses zero; the
 * default for MTLCommandQueueDescriptor is 64. Every ivar name above is the cache's own
 * (`ipsw dyld a2s`: OBJC_IVAR_$__MTLCommandQueue._commandBufferSemaphore,
 * OBJC_IVAR_$__MTLCommandBuffer._needsCommandBufferSemaphoreSignal), not a guess.
 *
 * So each command buffer takes one of 64 slots AND OWES A SIGNAL -- that ivar is Apple's
 * own name for the debt. In Apple's driver something on the completion path pays it. This
 * driver has no completion path at all: it overrides -commit and -waitUntilCompleted and
 * never calls -enqueueCommandBuffer:, -commitCommandBuffer:wake: or any of the rest, so
 * nothing in Metal will ever pay it for us. The 65th -commandBuffer then waits for ever.
 *
 * MEASURED, not reasoned: logs/114823-run.log. A test that made 64 command buffers (one
 * per shader of an 8x8 mosaic) blocked on the 65th inside -[MTLCommandQueue commandBuffer]
 * and stayed blocked for four minutes, with a heartbeat thread proving the process alive.
 * It is not a test bug: an application makes a command buffer per frame, so this driver
 * would hang anything that drew for a couple of seconds.
 *
 * The debt is paid at -commit, and that is a choice with a reason. Metal holds the slot
 * until the buffer completes; here -commit IS the completion -- the recorded work runs
 * inside it and -waitUntilCompleted only fences -- so holding it any longer would throttle
 * an application for a wait this driver does not have. A buffer that is never committed
 * pays at -dealloc instead, which is the case Apple's flag exists for.
 *
 * Both are done through the runtime by ivar NAME, and a name that is not there is said out
 * loud rather than worked around: on an iOS whose Metal keeps this differently, the right
 * answer is to find out, not to run with a queue that silently blocks at 64.

 * every one of them killed the daemon that sent it (logs/130132-run.log). Neither is in any
 * public header: both are required members of <MTLCommandQueueSPI>, which is declared in
 * AGXMetalA11.bundle and therefore does not exist in any process on this phone -- so
 * objc_getProtocol cannot be asked what this class owes, and the list was read out of the
 * cache instead (tools/metal/protometh.py, tools/metal/owes.py).
 *
 * -setGPUPriority: (B24@0:8Q16 -- NSUInteger in, BOOL out) is NOT bookkeeping.
 * -[IOGPUMetalCommandQueue setGPUPriority:] (0x1ec174cb8) calls _validateGPUPriority
 * (0x1ec178f74) and then -_setGPUPriority:backgroundPriority: (0x1ec178eec), which packs
 * the foreground and background numbers into a three-word request and hands it to the
 * kernel's own command-queue object (_IOGPUCommandQueueSetPriorityAndBackground); only if
 * the kernel accepts does it write the two ivars that -getGPUPriority reads back. So the
 * number is read by the GPU's scheduler, and the ivar is just a cache of what the scheduler
 * agreed to. The validation is worth copying exactly: anything above 5 is refused and 3 is
 * refused for a foreground queue -- "priority (%d) is not valid for foreground" is the
 * cache's own string -- and it only REPORTS, it does not stop the call, which is why
 * Apple's BOOL is the kernel's answer and not the validator's.
 *
 * This driver has one ring and one priority. Every command buffer goes to the kernel's
 * single msm ring in the order it was committed, and there is no second queue to be ahead
 * of; so there is nothing here to tell, and the honest answer is to remember the number,

 *
 * These are Metal's own numbers (MTLCommandBuffer.h): NotEnqueued 0, Enqueued 1, Committed 2,
 * Scheduled 3, Completed 4, Error 5. -[MTLCommandBuffer status] is how real code decides that a
 * buffer is done, so they are not cosmetic.
 *
 * Until 2026-10-21 this file answered 3 for committed, 4 for scheduled and 6 for completed -- and
 * 6 is not a status at all. Under those numbers an application comparing with
 * MTLCommandBufferStatusCompleted (4) saw completion the moment -commit returned, BEFORE the GPU
 * fence of -waitUntilCompleted was paid, and after the fence it saw a number Metal does not
 * define. Error was 5 by coincidence and has not moved.
 *
 * Every boot log under logs/ was written by the old numbering and none of them is going to be
 * regenerated, so those numbers have to be DATED rather than reinterpreted. That is what the
 * banner in -initWithRedwoodQueue: below is for: it names the numbering of the log that carries
 * it, and it is printed out of these constants, so the line cannot drift from what -status
 * answers. A log without that line is older than this change, and in it "status 6" is this
 * completion, "status 4" is a buffer that was only submitted, and 2 and 3 do not occur at all.
 * That is the rule tools/air/metalcheck.py reads a log by, and the measurement that makes it
 * safe: over all 141 logs in logs/ the only statuses the test ever printed are 5 (128 times) and
 * 6 (990 times) -- never 4.
 *
 * One file more keys on the old numbers and is NOT part of this change: userland/src/
 * metal_drv_test.m compares [cmd status] with the literal 6 in five places (its lines 1200, 1526,
 * 2041, 2293, 2795) and prints the literal "status 6" in a sixth (2308). Until those move, a boot
 * with this driver has the test calling every completed buffer a failure: the sweep prints
 * "drvtest: drawall <name> status 4" with nothing after it and reads back no pixel, and the single
 * draw returns before its own readback. metalcheck.py names that shape when it sees it.

 * classes: these, -commitWithDeadline: and -setThreadgroupPackingDisabled:).
 *
 * A mesh pipeline is two stages before the fragment one -- an object stage that decides how
 * much geometry to make and a mesh stage that makes it. This driver compiles a vertex and a
 * fragment function and nothing else, and the device answers no when asked whether mesh

 * Ending a pass is Apple's bookkeeping, and this override used to skip it.

 * the tail of its own -endEncoding (0x181a1f4a8: `objc_release(_commandBuffer);
 * _commandBuffer = nil`). An override that does nothing leaves that ivar set, and Apple's
 * -dealloc checks it:
 *
 *   0x181a1e5f4  cbz x8, +124      ; _commandBuffer nil -> nothing to say
 *   0x181a1e610  MTLReportFailure(0, "-[_MTLCommandEncoder dealloc]", 131,
 *                                 @"Command encoder released without endEncoding")
 *
 * and MTLReportFailure here is an abort(). That is the whole of logs/214841-run.log: that
 * line 86 times and 43 aborts of backboardd, one every ten seconds, all from
 * CA::OGL::MetalContext::warmup_shaders -- which for each attachment combination it warms
 * opens a render encoder, ends it immediately, and pops the autorelease pool it made it in
 * (0x188476304, 0x188476308, then the pop whose return address is +1064). So every warmed
 * pass cost one abort. It also leaked a retain on every command buffer any encoder touched,
 * which is the quieter half of the same mistake.
 *
 * So the superclass is called, and what that runs for us is measured rather than hoped --
 * every step is Apple's own code, and the long middle of the function is skipped:
 *
 *   [_commandBuffer executeSynchronizationNotifications:1]   real; our list is empty
 *   [_commandBuffer setCurrentCommandEncoder:nil]            real; an ivar write
 *   _isProgressTrackingEncoder is 0, so no short cut through, and then
 *   [_commandBuffer errorOptions] with bit 0 clear jumps straight to the tail
 *   objc_release(_commandBuffer); _commandBuffer = nil
 *
 * Calling it twice is safe: the second time every message goes to a nil ivar and the release
 * is a release of nil. The one branch not taken is framework-assisted error tracking
 * (`errorOptions` bit 0, MTLCommandBufferErrorOptionEncoderExecutionStatus): it would build
 * an `_MTLCommandBufferEncoderInfo` and ask this encoder -getDriverUniqueID, which is a
 * one-instruction forward to -globalTraceObjectID. Nothing here turns that option on, and if
 * something ever does, that selector is where to look.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do is seal the encoder. Metal calls encoding after
 * -endEncoding undefined, and this driver would still record it; refusing that is separate
 * work and nothing has asked for it.

/*
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MTLArgumentEncoder, which on this driver is a RECORDER and not a writer.
 *
 * Metal's encoder writes one 8-byte handle per member into a plain buffer, and those
 * handles are an Apple GPU's descriptors: a Gallium driver, which binds by index, cannot
 * read them. It also does not need to -- the AIR frontend resolves every member of every
 * set to a binding while translating (docs/air.md 8.2) -- so each -setBuffer:atIndex:
 * here RECORDS (resource, Metal id) against (the destination buffer, the destination
 * offset) in the compiler library, and the draw binds every member the pipeline's shaders
 * declare from those records. The buffer's contents are never read, and an argument
 * buffer the application filled by any other means is REFUSED BY NAME at the draw.
 *
 * Two things are deliberate about this object:
 *
 *   - IT HOLDS NO RECORDS ITSELF. Its state is (buffer, offset), and the records live
 *     with the destination buffer in the library, because that is what Metal's own object
 *     model allows: one buffer holds several encodings at several offsets, each reused
 *     across many draws, and an application may release the encoder and go on drawing
 *     with what it encoded.
 *   - -setArgumentBuffer:offset: DOES NOT CLEAR the encoding at that offset, which is
 *     Metal's behaviour: the bytes an earlier encoding wrote there are still there, so a
 *     second encoding that sets three of five members leaves the other two as they were.
 *
 * The layout comes from the module (`air.indirect_buffer`), so `encodedLength` and
 * `alignment` are Apple's own numbers -- 8 bytes per member the set declares and 8 --
 * which matters because the application allocates its buffer from them and then encodes
 * at multiples of them.

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * -[MTLFunction newArgumentEncoderWithBufferIndex:], which is a method of METAL'S OWN
 * class and is therefore installed at RUNTIME here rather than written as a category.
 *
 * Two decisions, and the first one is measured. Metal's own implementation cannot work on
 * this port:
 *
 *   -[_MTLFunction newArgumentEncoderWithBufferIndex:] (0x181aef7f4) forwards to
 *   ...reflection:binaryArchives: (0x181aef85c), which asks
 *   -[_MTLFunction reflectionWithOptions:binaryArchives:] (0x181aef458) for the
 *   function's reflection -- and that one calls -compiler, which on this port is
 *   -[_MTLDevice compiler] (0x181aac128), a two-instruction stub answering nil
 *   (docs/metal.md 10.7: everything behind Metal's own compiler is nil here). The
 *   builder then walks `[reflection arguments]`, finds a count of zero, and takes its
 *   failure path (0x181aef924):
 *
 *     MTLReportFailure(0, "-[_MTLFunction newArgumentEncoderWithBufferIndex:reflection:"
 *                      "functionReflection:]", 0x22fc,
 *                      @"bufferIndex %lu does not identify an argument buffer")
 *
 *   and returns nil.
 *
 * So the choice is not between Apple's implementation and ours; it is between nil and an
 * encoder. And what Metal was missing is what this port HAS: -[_MTLFunction bitcodeData]
 * works (docs/metal.md 10.12, checked over all eleven functions of AV1SW.metallib), and
 * the frontend reads the set's layout straight out of those bytes. Resident Evil 4 sends
 * this selector; so does any application that writes `[[id(n)]]` structs in MSL instead
 * of building MTLArgumentDescriptors.
 *
 * The second decision is HOW, and a category is the obvious way and the wrong one: a
 * category on `_MTLFunction` makes this dylib import `_OBJC_CLASS_$__MTLFunction`, and a
 * private class symbol that does not bind is a dylib that does not LOAD -- which would
 * take the whole driver down for every Metal client in the process, not just this
 * selector. The one private class symbol this driver does import,
 * `_OBJC_CLASS_$__MTLDevice`, is imported by IOGPU.framework too and has been measured
 * loading on the phone; `ipsw dyld symaddr -b` finds nothing in the cache that imports
 * _MTLFunction's, so nothing says it would bind. class_replaceMethod needs no symbol at
 * all, and it is the same move ensure_spi already makes for MTLDeviceSPI.
 *
 * What it costs, said plainly: the method is replaced for every MTLFunction in the
 * process, Apple's daemons included. Nothing is lost by that -- the implementation it
 * replaces returns nil for all of them, for the reason above -- and nothing else of
 * _MTLFunction is touched.
