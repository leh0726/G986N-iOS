"""The 135 library functions: how far each one gets, and against what.

An air.visible function is not a shader. Metal links one into a caller at
pipeline time through the ABI its own metadata describes (air.stitching_info),
which this project does not implement -- so a third of the corpus had nothing
that could be dispatched and was counted only as "not an entry point".

air_to_nir's --library wraps one in a generated entry point instead: argument i
read from device buffer 0 at byte 16*i, the return value written to buffer 1
(wrap_library_function in air_to_nir.c). That makes a library function runnable
and comparable, and this script reports what each comparison is worth, because
they are not worth the same thing:

  LLVM            the function compiled for this machine by llc and called with
                  the same bytes. Independent of everything of ours, and the
                  strongest evidence here. Available in full only for a
                  function that calls no air.* at all.
  LLVM + airdefs  the same, for a function whose air.* calls are all exactly
                  defined: airdefs.py gives those operations a body so llc can
                  execute them. Weaker and reported on its own line, because
                  LLVM then decides the function's own arithmetic while we
                  decide what its operations mean -- from intrincheck's
                  reference, which is itself pinned to the Adreno on 1 748
                  cases. A family with no bit-exact reference anywhere is
                  refused by name instead of approximated.
  folded vs run   our NIR constant-folded on this machine against our NIR run
                  by a Gallium driver. Not independent of the frontend -- a
                  mistranslation is on both sides -- but it does catch the
                  backend and the hardware disagreeing with the folder, which
                  is how the ir3 u32-to-f32 rounding bug was found.

Both sides read argument i from byte 16*i, so neither comparison can catch a
slot layout that is wrong in the same way twice. What they do catch is the two
sides disagreeing about which slot is which argument, because the fill pattern
makes every slot's bytes different. Apple's own air.arg_type_name for each
argument is checked against the LLVM signature before anything runs
(cpuref.py, check_against_metadata), which is the one part of the layout that
has a second source.

usage: libcheck.py [--list] [FILE.metallib...]
       libcheck.py --log RUN.log [FILE.metallib...]
       (no files: portrait_filters.metallib, the corpus's library)

--log reads a device run instead of running here: the words the Adreno wrote
into buffer 1, against the words our folder computes on this machine. A block
is keyed on the name air_run prints, not on the order of the lines, because the
console is shared with launchd and the loader drops its own middle when the log
grows (docs/checks.md in hackios-xnu-kernel).
